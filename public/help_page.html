    <h2>How to Use This Website</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the home page to test out some quick data searches for either an NHL team or NHL player. Enter a player name in the box, click search for player and results will be displayed. If you want to search for team data, enter the name of an NHL team and hit search to browse NHL team data!</li>
      <li>Click the Compare page to compare two players where you can view their milestones and career goals, points, and assists. You can also add a new NHL player to the supabase to add onto the player names that can display stats.</li>
      <li>Click the About page to learn which api's this project used and why I wanted to create this page</li>
      <li>In order to navigate from page to page, just click on the words in the navigation bar!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chart Meaning</h2>
    <p>The bar chart that you see on the home page shows the average amount of shots each team took in the most recent NHL season. You can highlight over each bar to get the exact average number for each team.</p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no API that is free that I could find to produce more information like home vs away, rivalry data, etc.</li>
      <li>Playoff stats are not included due to issues with API</li>
      <li>My supabase only has the top 50 players in terms of total points in their careers, so the data is limited to only the top 50 for the compare page</li>
      <li>There may be a delay in updates to the data as it is not instantly live updates</li>
      <li>The supabase data is entered manually from a CSV, so the career stats are able to be updated automatically, meaning it would be a bit outdated.</li>
    </ul>
