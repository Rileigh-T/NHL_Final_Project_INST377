      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This website that I have created can be used as as tool to analyze both NHL player performances and team performances across different game contexts. On the home page, users can quickly look up an NHL player and be provided with stats from the most recent NHL season. To the right of it, the user can also enter a NHL team and be prompted with stats from that teams most recent season along with a graph that displays shot counts for every NHL team. On the compare page, users can compare two NHL players by being able to access their milestone count, as well as their goals, assists, and points for their career (as long as they are in the top 250 players). The goal is to give users a clearer understanding of player and team dynamics over time.</p>

      <h2>APIs Used</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>NHL Stats API: https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/records-api.md</strong> This official, public API provides detailed information about NHL players, games, teams, and stats. I specifically used it to access the milestone records list.</li>
          <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Per assignment requirements, I used supabase to get some of my data. Specifically, this provided the career stats of players, where I used the data table in supabase to find the career goals, assists, and points for the top 50 players.</li>
         <li><strong>2nd NHL API: https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference?tab=readme-ov-file#get-player-information</strong> This API is similar to the first API, but has more detailed stats for skaters and the NHL in general. I used it to gather stats for the homepage for the player portion, as well as gathering the team stats. I also incoperated its use with the shot chart that can be seen on the homepage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Target Users</h2>
      <p>This tool is built for many different groups including hockey fans, data enthusiasts, and aspiring analysts who want to explore trends and insights in NHL player and team performance. It can also possibly help other non-target groups like fantasy hockey players, students, and sports bloggers looking for a deeper dive into the data that surrounds the NHL.</p>
