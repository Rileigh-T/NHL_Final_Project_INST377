Title: NHL Stats and Comparison Tool

Description: My project is made for NHL anlaysts/fans that want to get a closer and quick look at some of the NHL's most notable players and teams. Through my website, users will be able to view quick stats of the most recent season for all NHL players. They will also be able to see the stats for their favorite NHL team and the most recent season. If users navigate to the "Compare" tab in the navigation, they will be able to enter two players to compare milestones and career stats (as long as the players are in the top 50 in the history of the NHL). Users can also enter new player data so that the career stats database can be expanded upon.
